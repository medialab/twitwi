[![Build Status](https://github.com/medialab/twitwi/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/medialab/twitwi/actions)

# Twitwi

A collection of Twitter & Bluesky related helper functions for Python intended to preprocess JSON payloads from the platforms' APIs and return "normalized" flat versions in order to cleanup and optimize some fields before storing them into consistent tabular formats.

A description of the "normalized" fields [for Twitter is available here](twitwi/constants.py) and [for Bluesky there](twitwi/bluesky/types.py).

It also provides a few convenient tools to anonymize tweets data, convert it into other formats, or extract datetime/timestamp from Twitter IDs (without querying it to Twitter).

## Installation

You can install `twitwi` with pip with the following command:

```
pip install twitwi
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 +
- [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) (for timezones handling)
- [ural](https://github.com/medialab/ural?tab=readme-ov-file#ural) (for urls cleaning)

## Usage

**Bluesky (within `twitwi.bluesky`)**

*Normalization functions*

* [normalize_profile](#normalize_profile)
* [normalize_post](#normalize_post)

*Formatting functions*

* [transform_profile_into_csv_dict](#transform_profile_into_csv_dict)
* [transform_post_into_csv_dict](#transform_post_into_csv_dict)
* [format_profile_as_csv_row](#format_profile_as_csv_row)
* [format_post_as_csv_row](#format_post_as_csv_row)

*Useful constants (under `twitwi.bluesky.constants`)*

* [PROFILE_FIELDS](#profile_fields)
* [POST_FIELDS](#post_fields)

*Examples*

```python

# Working with Blueksy posts payloads coming directly from the API, either from clasical payloads,
# for instance via the routes app.bsky.feed.getPosts https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-feed-get-posts
# or app.bsky.feed.searchPosts https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-feed-search-posts
# or from feeds payloads, such as the route app.bsky.feed.getAuthorFeed https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-feed-get-author-feed

from twitwi.bluesky import normalize_post

normalized_posts = []
for post_data in posts_payload_from_API:
    normalized_posts.append(normalize_post(post_data))

    # Or to convert found datetimes into a local chosen timezone
    from pytz import timezone
    paris_tz = timezone('Europe/Paris')
    normalized_posts.append(normalize_post(post_data, locale=paris_tz))

    # Or to also produce full metadata for other posts embedded such as quotes or posts answered to:
    normalized_posts += normalize_post(post_data, extract_referenced_posts=True)    # Returns a list of dicts

# Then, saving normalized profiles into a CSV using DictWriter:

from csv import DictWriter
from twitwi.bluesky.constants import POST_FIELDS
from twitwi.bluesky import transform_post_into_csv_dict

with open("normalized_bluesky_posts.csv", "w") as f:
    w = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=POST_FIELDS)
    w.writeheader()
    for p in normalized_posts:
        transform_post_into_csv_dict(p)  # The function returns nothing, p has been mutated
        w.writerow(p)

# Or using the basic CSV writer:

from csv import writer
from twitwi.bluesky import format_post_as_csv_row

with open("normalized_bluesky_posts.csv", "w") as f:
    w = csv.writer(f)
    w.writerow(POST_FIELDS)
    for p in normalized_posts:
        w.writerow(format_post_as_csv_row(p))


# Similarily, working with Bluesky user profiles coming directly from the API
# for instance via the route app.bsky.actor.getProfiles https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-actor-get-profiles

from twitwi.bluesky import normalize_profile

normalized_profiles = []
for profile_data in profiles_payload_from_API:
    normalized_profiles.append(normalize_profile(profile_data))

    # Or in the local timezone
    normalized_profiles.append(normalize_profile(profile_payload, locale=paris_tz))

# Then saving as a CSV with csv.writer or csv.DictWriter similarily:

from twitwi.bluesky.constants import PROFILE_FIELDS
from twitwi.bluesky import transform_profile_into_csv_dict, format_profile_as_csv_row

with open("normalized_bluesky_profiles.csv", "w") as f:
    w = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=PROFILE_FIELDS)
    w.writeheader()
    for p in normalized_profiles:
        transform_profile_into_csv_dict(p)  # The function returns nothing, p has been mutated
        w.writerow(p)

with open("normalized_bluesky_profiles.csv", "w") as f:
    w = csv.writer(f)
    w.writerow(PROFILE_FIELDS)
    for p in normalized_profiles:
        w.writerow(format_profile_as_csv_row(p))
```

### normalize_profile

Function taking a nested dict describing a user profile from Bluesky's JSON payload and returning a flat "normalized" dict composed of all [PROFILE_FIELDS](#profile_fields) keys.

Will return datetimes as UTC but can take an optional second `locale` argument as a [`pytz`](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) string timezone.

*Arguments*

Will return datetimes as UTC but can take an optional last `locale` argument as a `pytz` string timezone.

When setting `extract_referenced_posts` to `True` it will instead return a list of dicts including the desired post as well as each referenced ones such as quoted posts and potentially parent posts of a conversation when the data comes from a Bluesky `feed` payload.

If `False`, the function will return a `dict`, if `True` a `list` of `dict`. Defaults to `False`.
* **collection_source** *(string, optional)*: An optional information to add within the `collected_via` field of the normalized post to indicate whence it was collected.

anonymize_normalized_tweet(normalized_tweet)
```

### get_timestamp_from_id

# Or converting to a chosen timezone
from pytz import timezone
paris_tz = timezone('Europe/Paris')

date_time = get_dates_from_id(tweet_ID, locale=paris_tz)
```
